# Bookapp

A simple booking app i do on my free time.

## Get started

Install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Then start Webpack:

```bash
yarn dev
```

The website is launched at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).


## Deploying to the web

### With [now](https://zeit.co/now)

Install `now` if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g now
```

Then, from within your project folder:

```bash
now
```

As an alternative, use the [Now desktop client](https://zeit.co/download) and simply drag the unzipped project folder to the taskbar icon.

### With [surge](https://surge.sh/)

Install `surge` if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g surge
```

Then, from within your project folder:

npm run build
surge public
